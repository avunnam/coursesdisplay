I have developed this student app where we can to display the available courses.
In the process i developed another app called course.
In student app  urls.py file is redirected to the course.urls.
In course app urls.py file is redirected to the index which is written in views.py file.
In views.py file is redirected to homepage.html.
In homepage.html all the code regarding to the diaplay of available courses is written.
we have another folder name static where the course.css file is written.
In homepage.html the static file is loaded.
